Use FastAPI for:
    Complex AI and trading logic.
    Data fetching and aggregation from financial APIs.
    User authentication (JWT, OAuth).
Use Next.js API routes for:
    Proxying requests to FastAPI to avoid direct exposure of backend URLs.
    Handling SSR/SSG needs that require backend data.


Recommended Approach for Your Use Case

Since your project involves:
    AI and momentum trading strategies: This logic is better suited for FastAPI, leveraging Python libraries.
    A dashboard with dynamic charts and performance metrics: Use Next.js for SSR and client-side rendering.

You can likely stick with FastAPI as the sole backend unless you need:
    A proxy for routing or simplifying API calls.
    Lightweight backend logic that complements your frontend.
